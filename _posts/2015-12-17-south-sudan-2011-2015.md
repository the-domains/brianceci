South Sudan 2011-2015

**South Sudan's first few years of independence.  Documented.**  
It's an extremely complex situation that's going on in South Sudan on a regular basis, but to understand what's happening in this incredibly passionate nation, here's a few facts to help understand the situation:

Sudan initially was in tension and generally split between two **very different **ethnic groups, Arab North, and Black Tribal South.    
In 2011 a referedum was announced on whether the region of South Sudan should be part of Sudan or become independent.  In July 2011, 98.83% of South Sudan were in favour of independence.    
My first arrival was in December 2011, within a few months of the newest country in the world.  At this point, hardly anyone was under arms, and the nation seemed at peace.   
After returning in 2012, 2013 and 2015, each year has been incredibly different in terms of security.  While with the Obakki Foundation, we've seen the country struggle from a nation of hope and prosperity to fear of themselves.  At this point of writing, there have been more than one million people displaced from their homes.
